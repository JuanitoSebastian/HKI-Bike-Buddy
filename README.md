# HKI Bike Buddy
![HKIBikeBuddy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuanitoSebastian/HelsinkiBikeBuddy/main/Documentation/graphics/ReadMeHeader.png)
An iOS app for viewing real-time information of city bike stations in Helsinki, Espoo and Vantaa. HKI Bike Buddy was designed with usability and simplicity in mind. Instead of having to search a map to find the nearest bike rental stations, the app shows the stations as a list ordered from closest to furthest from the user. Bike rental stations can be favourited for easy access and favourite stations can be placed on the home screen as widgets.
